# AI-Powered Student Assistant (MERN + AI Integration)

## Project Overview

AI-Powered Student Assistant is a small MERN-based web application that allows users to input questions or text, select a task mode, and receive an AI-generated response using an LLM API.

The project demonstrates how an AI service can be integrated into a MERN stack application while controlling the AI output using structured prompts.

Users can perform multiple AI-powered tasks such as explaining concepts, summarizing text, improving writing quality, and generating multiple-choice questions.

## Live Demo

Frontend: https://ai-student-assistant-ruddy.vercel.app  

Backend API: https://ai-student-assistant-vmts.onrender.com

Note: The backend is hosted on a free server and may take 20–30 seconds to respond on the first request due to server cold start.


# Features

### AI Task Modes

The application supports four AI task modes:

1. **Explain Concept**

   * Explains technical or academic topics in simple language.

2. **Generate MCQs**

   * Generates structured multiple-choice questions in JSON format.

3. **Summarize Text**

   * Produces concise summaries of long text inputs.

4. **Improve Writing Quality**

   * Enhances grammar, clarity, and structure of user text.

# API Endpoint

### Generate AI Response

**POST**

```
/api/ai/generate
```

### Request Body

```json
{
  "prompt": "Explain JavaScript closures",
  "mode": "explain"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "result": "AI generated response"
}
```

---

# Prompt Engineering Approach

The application uses structured prompts instead of sending raw user input to the AI model.

Each task mode constructs a different prompt template.

### Explain Concept Mode

```
You are an experienced university instructor.

Explain the following concept to a beginner student.

Rules:
- Use simple language
- Keep explanation under 150 words
- If unsure, respond that the information may not be reliable.

Concept: {{user_input}}
```

### MCQ Generation Mode

The AI is instructed to produce structured JSON output.

```
Generate 3 multiple choice questions about the following topic.

Topic: {{user_input}}

Return JSON format:

{
 "questions":[
   {
    "question":"",
    "options":["A","B","C","D"],
    "answer":""
   }
 ]
}
```

### Summarization Mode

```
Summarize the following text in 5 bullet points.

Text: {{user_input}}
```

### Improve Writing Mode

```
Improve grammar, clarity, and structure of the following text.

Text: {{user_input}}
```

# Guardrails Against Hallucination

Prompt instructions include constraints such as:

* Respond with uncertainty if reliable information is not available.
* Follow strict output formatting.
* Limit response length when required.

These guardrails help reduce hallucinated or irrelevant outputs.

---

# Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside the **server** directory.

```
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
PORT=5000
```

Important: `.env` must not be committed to GitHub.
